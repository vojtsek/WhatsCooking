# WhatsCooking
Neural network recognizing the national cuisine.

scripts:

*loadData.py*: takes no arguments, reads the data from json file and creates files that store the matrix and the ingredients set
(TODO: parametrization)

*mlpclassifier.py*: USAGE: mlpclassifier.py -d dataFile.json -i ingredientsFile -m matrixFile
takes the file with JSON and two files generated by the *loadData.py*
trains the network and stores it

*recall.py*: USAGE: recall.py -d dataFile.json -n networkFile -i ingredientsFile -m matrixFile
takes same files as *mlpclassifier.py* plus the stored network, recalls the outputs
could be useful to get data without repeated training
